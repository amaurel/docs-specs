==============================================
Add UI content guidelines to Contributor Guide
==============================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+spec/ux-personas

Add OpenStack personas within the OpenStack
Documentation Contributor Guide under the UI guidelines section.

Problem description
===================

The OpenStack UX project is interested in adding a section to the
OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide that describes personas
developed by the OpenStack UX project team.

Users can apply personas to development design decisions,
use personas as IA resources for new and changing guide
evaluating requirements, guides, and employed in possible
marketing collateral.

The value of this effort is to help provide developers,
designers, and reviewers with an improved awareness
of OpenStack users. With this awareness, they can
design and develop OpenStack with the appropriate
audience goals, and resulting task flows, in mind.
Personas help establish consistency across projects, increase
awareness for the customer and their goals, and
communicate the differences between specific customers.

Proposed change
===============

In a new UX/UI section of the contributor guide, add a topic
collection for personas. The personas section could be
added as a peer to both the UI text guidelines (already exist) and to
the (proposed) UI heuristic checklist section within the OpenStack
Documentation Contributor Guide.

Proposed table of contents:

UX/UI guidelines (section title updated to reflect broader scope)

* Value/Intro
* UI text guidelines (already exist)
* UI heuristic checklist (new, proposed in separate spec)
* UX personas (new, proposed by this spec)

In the personas section, the following personas will be elaborated
upon.

Cloud Personas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The personas information will be based upon model companies and
their ecosystems. They describe the cloud adoption stages and
describe multiple roles defined with each company. Roles that
perform similar tasks may be called something different in each
company. It is also common for the same person to perform
multiple roles or shared tasks. Early research
shows that the role ecosystem is complex and diverse.

Contact Piet Kruithof (See :ref:`assignee` below) for the
most recent version of the personas.

Alternatives
------------

#. Do not add UX personas.
#. Add personas, but create them in a new guide for UX design tools.
   An email was distributed to the doc project regarding
   the idea of a new UX design guide to house UX-related
   resources and tools for a cross-project audience. These were
   the options discussed in the email (sent 3/7/16). Please see
   the docs mailing list or OpenStack email archive for
   more details and history.

   Option A
    Create a OpenStack UX Design Guide: Tools for
    developers guide, under the Contributor Guides section
    on docs.openstack.org. The guide would house UX design materials,
    like engaging UX, personas, use cases, and a resources
    section with a heuristic checklists, etc. Basically, creating
    a design corner concept. Guide name is to be decided.

    * Pros: A peer to other contributor guides. Creates a more
      prominent focus on UX/UI design in OpenStack. We could reference
      the guide from appropriate locations to increase visibility.
    * Cons: New guide-logistics are more complicated - logistics help
      needed. This option takes longer to get reviews going.

   Option B
    Add to the existing Doc Contributor Guide, but modify the guide's scope.

    * Pros: Existing guide-logistics easier, and content would be
      available to review sooner. The UI guidelines and content
      would be in one location.
      The new UI heuristic checklist links to the UI text guidelines
      that we recently added to the doc contributor guide.
    * Cons: Not just for text guidelines anymore, so the current
      guide scope would expand slightly to include a section
      specifically on UX/UI tools for a cross-project audience.

   Option C
    Add to the existing Doc Contributor Guide as-is, potentially adjust later.

    * Pros: Content available for review quickly, lowest logistical impact.
    * Cons: Scope could be confusing for users, adjusting later delays
      some work.
